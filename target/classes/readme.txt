To support hibernate, spring provides 2 important beans: 
LocalSessionFactoryBean: creates a Hibernateâ€™s SessionFactory which is injected into Hibernate-based DAO classes.
HibernateTransactionManager: provides transaction support code for a SessionFactory. Programmers can use @Transactional annotation in DAO methods to avoid writing boiler-plate transaction code explicitly.

Checking with Git if everything went right

Ran into problems with MySQL ports. Have been a problem for a while but figured out that it is something to do with port
In my system, the port is 3307 instead of 3306.
