LocalSessionFactoryBean: creates a Hibernateâ€™s SessionFactory which is injected into Hibernate-based DAO classes.
HibernateTransactionManager: provides transaction support code for a SessionFactory. Programmers can use @Transactional annotation in DAO methods to avoid writing boiler-plate transaction code explicitly.
